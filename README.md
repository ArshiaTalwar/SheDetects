# SheDetects
#Developed a deep learning model using transfer learning with ResNet50 to classify breast cancer from histopathology images.
#Fine-tuned the pre-trained ResNet model for binary classification (Malignant vs. Benign)
Achieved model evaluation using F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and other performance metrics via Scikit-learn.
Utilized Google Colab for model training and experimentation with GPU acceleration.

ðŸ“Š Highlights:
Applied transfer learning and fine-tuning to adapt ImageNet-trained ResNet50 to medical imaging tasks.

Automated dataset handling using Kaggle API and implemented preprocessing pipelines for histopathological image data.
