# SheDetects
Developed a deep learning model using transfer learning with ResNet50 to classify breast cancer from histopathology images.<br/>
Fine-tuned the pre-trained ResNet model for binary classification (Malignant vs. Benign).<br/>
Achieved model evaluation using F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and other performance metrics via Scikit-learn.<br/>
Utilized Google Colab for model training and experimentation with GPU acceleration.<br/>

<h3>ðŸ“Š Highlights:</h3>
Applied fine-tuning to adapt ImageNet-trained ResNet50 to medical imaging tasks.<br/>

Automated dataset handling using Kaggle API and implemented preprocessing pipelines for histopathological image data.
